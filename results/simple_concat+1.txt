truth: ['clindamycin', 'gentamicin']

sentence: All 20 strains of enterococcus, three strains of Clostridium, three strains of Escherichia coli, and one strain of Proteus rettgeri were resistant to both clindamycin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 3.1 mug/ml) and gentamicin (minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 6.2 mug/ml). 
predictions: ['Clostridium', 'Proteus', 'clindamycin', 'gentamicin']
truth: ['clindamycin', 'gentamicin']

sentence: Combinations of clindamycin and gentamicin were indifferent for 16 and synergistic for 11 of the resistant strains. 
predictions: ['clindamycin', 'gentamicin']
truth: ['clindamycin', 'gentamicin']

sentence: Except for clindamycin-sensitive isolates, synergy was usually observed only at concentrations of one or both drugs which are not readily obtainable in vivo. 
predictions: []
truth: ['clindamycin']

sentence: Antagonism was never observed.
predictions: []
truth: []

sentence: Hypothermia as an index of the disulfiram-ethanol reaction in the rat.

predictions: ['disulfiram-ethanol']
truth: ['disulfiram', 'ethanol']

sentence: Decreased core temperature in female rats was investigated as one possible index of the disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER). 
predictions: ['disulfiram-ethanol', 'DER']
truth: ['disulfiram', 'ethanol']

sentence: Core temperature was decreased in rats in a dose-dependent manner when ethanol was administered to rats treated with disulfiram 8 hours before the ethanol challenge. 
predictions: ['ethanol', 'disulfiram', 'ethanol']
truth: ['ethanol', 'disulfiram', 'ethanol']

sentence: The decrease in temperature began within 20 minutes after ethanol administration, reaching a maximal decrease between 60 and 120 minutes post ethanol. 
predictions: ['ethanol', 'ethanol']
truth: ['ethanol', 'ethanol']

sentence: The core temperature returned to normal 300 minutes after ethanol. 
predictions: ['ethanol']
truth: ['ethanol']

sentence: The blood pressure (carotid cannulation) decreased along with the core temperature. 
predictions: ['carotid']
truth: []

sentence: Maximal hypotension was found 120 minutes post ethanol, and returned to normal 300 minutes after ethanol. 
predictions: ['ethanol', 'ethanol']
truth: ['ethanol', 'ethanol']

sentence: Heart rate increased initially and returned to normal 40 minutes after ethanol challenge.
predictions: ['ethanol']
truth: ['ethanol']

sentence: Dexamethasone and retinyl acetate similarly inhibit and stimulate EGF- or insulin-induced proliferation of prostatic epithelium.
predictions: ['Dexamethasone', 'retinyl', 'prostatic epithelium']
truth: ['Dexamethasone', 'retinyl acetate', 'EGF', 'insulin']

sentence: Prostatic epithelium proliferates in a defined medium consisting of basal medium RPMI1640 containing transferrin (1 microgram/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), and insulin (3.7 micrograms/ml or 0.1 IU/ml). 
predictions: ['Prostatic epithelium', 'transferrin', 'EGF', 'insulin']
truth: ['transferrin', 'EGF', 'insulin']

sentence: Although neither dexamethasone nor retinyl acetate affected the proliferation of prostatic epithelium in RPMI1640 containing transferrin alone, they modify the mitogenic effect of EGF and insulin. 
predictions: ['dexamethasone', 'retinyl', 'prostatic epithelium', 'EGF', 'insulin']
truth: ['dexamethasone', 'retinyl acetate', 'transferrin', 'EGF', 'insulin']

sentence: Dexamethasone at 10(-10) M or retinyl acetate at about 3 X 10(-9) M inhibits proliferation stimulated by EGF. 
predictions: ['Dexamethasone', 'EGF']
truth: ['Dexamethasone', 'retinyl acetate', 'EGF']

sentence: Higher concentrations of dexamethasone (10(-8) - 10(-6) M) or retinyl acetate (3 X 10(-8) - 10(-7) M) enhance the mitogenic activity of EGF. 
predictions: ['dexamethasone', 'retinyl', 'EGF']
truth: ['dexamethasone', 'retinyl acetate', 'EGF']

sentence: Dexamethasone had a similar effect in the presence of insulin. 
predictions: ['Dexamethasone', 'insulin']
truth: ['Dexamethasone', 'insulin']

sentence: However, retinyl acetate stimulated, but did not significantly inhibit, proliferation in the presence of insulin. 
predictions: ['retinyl', 'insulin']
truth: ['retinyl acetate', 'insulin']

sentence: These results suggest that both dexamethasone and retinyl acetate, and possibly other glucocorticoids and retinoids, may regulate the proliferation of prostate epithelium by a dose-dependent modification of the activity of insulin and EGF.
predictions: ['dexamethasone', 'retinyl acetate', 'glucocorticoids', 'retinoids', 'prostate', 'insulin', 'EGF']
truth: ['dexamethasone', 'retinyl acetate', 'glucocorticoids', 'retinoids', 'insulin', 'EGF']
