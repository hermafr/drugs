General: Significant interactions may occur when celecoxib is administered together with drugs that inhibit P450 2C9.

DDI-DrugBank.d172.s1:
Celecoxib metabolism is predominantly mediated via cytochrome P450 2C9 in the liver.

DDI-DrugBank.d480.s28:
In addition, certain drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including many antidepressants (clozapine, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and others), may inhibit the activity of this isozyme, and thus may make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers with regard to concomitant therapy with other drugs metabolized by this enzyme system, leading to drug interaction.

DDI-DrugBank.d478.s0:
Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions.

DDI-DrugBank.d478.s1:
Because there is a theoretical basis that these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and naratriptan within 24 hours is contraindicated.

No drugs are known to interfere with the conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin.
fosphenytoin phenytoin None fosphenytoin VB

DDI-DrugBank.d40.s1:
Conversion could be affected by alterations in the level of phosphatase activity, but given the abundance and wide distribution of phosphatases in the body it is unlikely that drugs would affect this activity enough to affect conversion of fosphenytoin to phenytoin.
fosphenytoin phenytoin None fosphenytoin VB

DDI-DrugBank.d40.s2:
Drugs highly bound to albumin could increase the unbound fraction of fosphenytoin.

DDI-DrugBank.d40.s3:
Although, it is unknown whether this could result in clinically significant effects, caution is advised when administering Cerebyx with other drugs that significantly bind to serum albumin.

DDI-DrugBank.d40.s6:
Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement.

DDI-DrugBank.d40.s7:
Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism.

DDI-DrugBank.d40.s8:
Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity.

DDI-DrugBank.d40.s9:
Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes.
